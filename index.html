							<h3 style="color: #4696e5">Experiences üíº</h3>
							<p>In my third year, I completed a four-month work placement with the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands, 
								where I collaborated with a local food producer, Oliver Carty Pork & Bacon, in Athlone. 
								My team and I were tasked with developing a user-friendly mobile application to log information about their products in stores. 
								My primary responsibility was overseeing the design and functionality of the application, ensuring it met the user needs.</p>

							<h3 style="color: #4696e5">Achievements üèÜ</h3>
							<p>I've accomplished a number of goals in my four years of software design studies that I'm genuinely proud of. 
								During the summer months of 2025 I took part in a 9 week Software Engineering course that was supplied by Ericsson and Skillnet.
								It gave me the opportunity to meet and work with new people to plan, design and build a working application for Ericsson themselves.
								The course also gave me a refresher course on my Java fundamentals which was extremely helpful in improving my technical thinking.</p>

							<p>	Creating a mobile application for Oliver Carty Meats has been my greatest accomplishment to date. 
								This was the longest project I've ever worked on, and it gave me tremendous experience working on a real software project with a corporation. 
								I appreciate the perspective and am pleased with the result  and grateful for the insight it gave me into working in a professional software environment.</p>

							<h3 style="color: #4696e5">Programming Language Skills üë®‚Äçüíª</h3>
							<p>I have a solid foundation in object-oriented programming, with knowledge in Java, JavaScript, Python, and HTML. 
								I‚Äôve applied these languages across various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), including Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm, 
								to develop robust software solutions. My experience includes building mobile applications, scripting, and creating interactive web components.</p>

							<h3 style="color: #4696e5">Personal Skills üí¨</h3>
							<p>Throughout my four-year course, I developed strong communication skills by actively participating in group projects. 
								Working closely with other students not only helped me build connections but also taught me new approaches to project planning, team discussions, 
								and collaborative coding. This experience gave me confidence in sharing ideas effectively and considering diverse perspectives.</p>

							<p>	My presentation skills are continuously improving. 
								During my work placement, I delivered weekly stand-up presentations to report on project progress. 
								This experience helped me become more comfortable presenting in a professional setting and equipped me with the ability to 
								communicate technical updates clearly to diverse audiences.
							</p>

							<p>I consider myself a team player, consistently striving to contribute and collaborate effectively in group settings. 
								Whether in academic projects or professional environments, I focus on achieving shared goals, offering support, and valuing each team member‚Äôs input.</p>
